## Requirements

You will need to have installed these tools:

- Node.js v16 or later
- Bazel v4.2.1 or later
- Redis
- MySQL v8

### [Bazel](https://bazel.build)

The easiest way to install the correct Bazel version is through Bazelisk via
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bazel/bazelisk):

```sh
npm i -g @bazel/bazelisk
```
