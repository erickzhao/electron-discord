title: Understanding the Bazel
---

This is a super simple guide on how to modify the Bazel-related files (`BUILD`
and `WORKSPACE`) and how the modules work.

## WORKSPACE file

This file is used to require other modules, the most important parts here are
the `rules_nodejs` part, with `node_repositories` and `yarn_install` parts.
Docker is not very important, he just works.

To update the version of `Node.js` runtime you need to change `node_version` in
the `node_repositories` block. Please notice that the versions are pulled from
`rules_nodejs` and can't be available at the time.

## BUILD file

If we take a look for the
[BUILD](https://github.com/siberianmh/electron-discord/blob/main/packages/bot/BUILD)
file in the `//packages/bot` directory, we can probably notice the similarities
to GN syntax (probably ðŸ™ˆ).

## Running

To run the bot you need to use `bazel run //packages/bot:serve` command where
the `//packages/bot` is a path to the directory and `:serve` is a name of the
command. Most of the projects here use the `:serve` command to run the binary.
